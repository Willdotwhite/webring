# Will's Simple Webring

This webring isn't really a webring.

I'm so good at naming things.

This is a static JSON file accessible here: https://willdotwhite.github.io/webring/data.json

All members of the community can fetch this file on demand and do whatever they like with it - traditional webring, list of people in an <aside>, interactive web game; the sky's the limit!

# Joining the webring

1. Submit a pull request to `data.json` to add yourself to the list
2. Ping me to let me know you've done it
3. Integrate it into your website somehow

# Join Criteria

I know you, or someone I trust vouches for you :D

This is not a public webring (yet) but a webring of friends and the cool stuff they do.

# Adding your site to the code

Fill in your details in the JSON list - the setup is this:

```json
{
  "name": "What name would you like to be referred to",
  "title": "Short title of your site/project",
  "description": "One line sentence that others can use to signpost your site",
  "url": "https://theactuallyonlyimportantthinginthe.list"
}
```
